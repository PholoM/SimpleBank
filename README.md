# SimpleBank
Simple version of the bank app

This program is part of a multi-level series, where this program functionality is improved with every iteration. 
Level 1 -> This stage
has the following functions:
- Check balance
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- exit

in the main menu. In addition to these, there is also

-> ChecckInput() which insures the input is the expected type

-> checkPin() and checkUser() which compares the login credentials against those contained in the program.

This is what is to be expected for the upcoming levels
-> Level 2: separate class into its own file, enter and store new users in an encrypted textfile.
-> Level 3: New functionality: show history and produce mini-statement.
-> Level 3: Introduce a card as an identification token.
-> Level 4: Store the data online.

The other aim of this project was to practice the C/C++ concepts. The following is a list of important concepts used 
in this project:
-> pointer to class functions
-> classes and objects
